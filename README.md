# HMD Project
PizzaBot by Francesco Vaccari and Mattia Tognato


To reproduce the intrinsic evaluation results do:
cd rasa\ project
python3 evaluation.py

It might take a couple of hours, in the end the results will be in the folders nlu_comparison, core_alternative and core_main. The log of terminal output will be in the log.txt file.
